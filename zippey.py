#  Zippey: A Git filter for friendly handling of ZIP-based files
#
#  There are many types of ZIP-based files, such as  Microsoft Office .docx,
#  .xlsx, .pptx files, OpenOffice .odt files and jar files, that contains
#  plaintext content but not really tractable by git due to compression smears
#  parts that have been modified and parts that remain the same across commit.
#  This prevent Git from versioning these files and treat them as a new binary
#  blob every time the file is saved.
#
#  Zippey is a Git filter that un-zip zip-based file into a simple text format
#  during git add/commit ("clean" process) and recover the original zip-based
#  file after git checkout ("smudge" process). Since diff is taken on the
#  "cleaned" file after file is added, it is likely real changes to file can be
#  reflected by original git diff command.
#
#  The text format is defined as a series of records. Each records represent a
#  file in the original zip-based file, which is composed of two parts,
#  a header that contains meta file and a body that contains data. The header
#  is a few data fields segmented by pipe character like this:
#
#       length|raw_length|type|filename
#
#  where length is an ascii coded integer of the following data section, raw_length
#  is the orginal length of data (if transformation is taken), type can be A for
#  text data or B for binary data, and filename is the original file name
#  including path if the zip-based file contains directories. Immediately after
#  the header, there is a carriage return ('\n'), follows "length" byte of
#  data, and then another CR and then the next recor, i,e,
#
#       [header1]\n[data1]\n[header2]\n[data2] ...
#
#  There are two types of data section. If the file contains only text data,
#  its content is copied to data section without any change, otherwise, data
#  is base64 coded to ensure the entire file is text format.
